# Perl modules

## What is a Perl module

Perl modules are a set of related functions in a library file. They are specifically designed to be reusable by other modules or programs. There are more than 100,000 modules ready for you to use on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use XS (they are written in C) so require a C compiler. Modules may have dependencies on other modules (almost always on CPAN) and cannot be installed without them (or without a specific version of them). Many modules on CPAN now require a recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above).

The reason that we need to use Perl module is Perl module can largely reduce our coding work.
