# Input and output in Perl

## Input

### Standard input

### Input from a file on the dist

```{perl code=readLines("code_perl/open_file.pl"), eval=FALSE}
```

```{sh comment="Output"}
perl code_perl/open_file.pl
```


### Special variable `$_`

```{perl code=readLines("code_perl/open_file.pl"), eval=FALSE}
```

When you are using `while` and `foreach`, the content will be assigned to `$_` if you don't assign it explicitly to any variable. 

For some build-in functions (`chomp`, `length`, `split` and `print`),   

I do NOT suggest you to use `$_` because `$_` will reduce the readerbility of the code. 


In Perl, $_ is a powerful 
In Perl, several functions and operators use this variable as a default, in case no parameter is explicitly used. In general, I'd say you should NOT see $_ in real code. I think the whole point of $_ is that you don't have to write it explicitly.



### The input record separator: `$/`

`$/` is the input record separator. By default, `$/` equals newline (`\n`). 

You could actually change the value of `$/`. For example, by assigning the greate-than '>' like this: `$/ = ">"`;. Then every call to the read-line operator `$chunk = <FILEHANDLE>` will read in all the characters up-to and including the first '>'.

We could also assign longer strings to `$/` and then that would be the input record separator.

#### How to process `fasta` file by changing `$/`

FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which base pairs or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes (A, T, G, C, etc.). 

In `fasta` format, each sequence begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column.

Here is an example of fasta file (Figure \@ref(fig:fastaPYL)). 

(ref:fastaPYL) Protein sequence of PYL10 in Arabidopsis.

```{r fastaPYL, fig.cap='(ref:fastaPYL)', outwidth="40%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fasta_pyl10_ara.png")
```



```{perl code=readLines("code_perl/fa_seq_len.pl"), eval=FALSE}
```

You can consider the content in the fasta file as a string (Figure  \@ref(fig:fastaString)) sperarated by `\n>`. 

We set the input record separator `$/` as `\n>`.  

In the first cycle of the `while` loop, the first chunk is `>chr1\nACGCTAGCTAGTCAGTCGATCGT\nCGTAGCTAGCTAG\n>`. 

You should notice that there is a leading `>` in the first chunk. So you need to use `s/^>//` to remove the leading `>`. 

To remove the trailing `\n>`, you can use `chomp $chunk;`. Then the string is:

```
chr1\nACGCTAGCTAGTCAGTCGATCGT\nCGTAGCTAGCTAG
```

The string before first `\n` is the sequence ID. The string after the first `\n` is the sequence. To get the sequnce ID and sequnce and assign to two variables, you can use `split(/\n/, $chunk, 2)`. Here LIMIT is set to 2, it represents the maximum number (here 2) of fields into which the EXPR may be split. 

The goal of this code is to output the sequence IDs and their lengths. Currently the string of the variable (`$seq`) is `ACGCTAGCTAGTCAGTCGATCGT\nCGTAGCTAGCTAG`. To do this, you first need to remove `\n` in the sequence by using `$seq =~ s/\n//g;`. Now the string of the variable (`$seq`) is `ACGCTAGCTAGTCAGTCGATCGTCGTAGCTAGCTAG`. Then built-in function `length` can be used to calculate the length of the sequence. The function `print` is used to output the sequnce ID and the length of the sequence. 

In the second cycles of the `while` loop, the chunk is
`chr2\nCTGCGGGCTAAATCGATCGATCG\nGTACGTACGAGCTAGCTA\n>`. 

Unlike the first chunk, there is no leading `>` in the second chunk. So the code `s/^>//` will do nothing for the second chunk. 

The following steps is the same as you can do for the first cycle. 

In the third cycle of the `while` loop, you can do the same thing on the third sequence. 

(ref:fastaString) Fasta string. 

```{r fastaString, fig.cap='(ref:fastaString)', outwidth="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fasta_string.png")
```

```{sh comment=NA}
perl code_perl/fa_seq_len.pl
```
