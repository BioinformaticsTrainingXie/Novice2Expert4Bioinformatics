# File transfer

## Transferring files between local computer and Linux server

To transfer files between local computer and Linux sever, there are two options: 1) GUI application and 2) command line.


* Open FileZilla and then click `File` -> `Site Manager`.

GUI means there will be window, buttons, menus, etc. The most popular system with GUI is Windows system (Figure \@ref(fig:filezilla_screenshot1)).

(ref:filezilla_screenshot1) FileZilla application. 

```{r filezilla_screenshot1, fig.cap='(ref:filezilla_screenshot1)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/filezilla_screenshot1.png")
```


### Use command line tools

`rsync` compares the files at each end and transfers only the changed parts of changed files. When you transfer files the first timeo it behaves pretty much like scp, but for a second transfer, where most files are unchanged, it will push a lot less data than scp. It's also a convenient way to restart failed transfers - you just reissue the same command and it will pick up where it left off the time before, whereas scp will start again from scratch.

#### Copying Files with `scp` 

The command `scp` is short for secure copy. It can be used to copy files between hosts on a network. It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as ssh(1).`Scp` will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.

File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host. Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers. Copies between two remote hosts are also permitted.

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl on 198.211.107.37 to the current directory.
scp guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/test.pl ./
```

To copy files from a server to a client, you need to know where the files are located on the server. For example, to copy a single file `~/test.pl` from the server with IP address of 198.211.107.37 to the current directory. 

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl in the current directory to  198.211.107.37
scp ./test.pl guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/
```

To copy files from a client to a server, you need to know where the files you want to put on the server. For example, to copy a single file `test.pl` from the current folder to the HOME folder of the server with IP address of 198.211.107.37. 

If you want to copy an entire directory recursively, you can use `-r` argument. See the example below: 

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl in the current directory to  198.211.107.37
scp -r guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/bioinfo/ ./
```

### Download files 

```
wget <url>
```

Resume 

```
wget -c <url>  
```
