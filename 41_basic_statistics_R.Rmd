## Probability distribution 


### Geometirc distribution

The geometric distribution is the distribution of the number of trials needed to get get the first success in repeated independent Bernolli trails. 


### Bionomial distribution 

The binomial distribution is the distribution of the number of successes (X) in  a fixed number (_n_) if independent Bernolli trails. 

### Negative binomial distribution


The negative bionomial distribution distribution is the distribution of the number of trials needed (X) to get the _r_th success (r). 



$$
\left(\begin{array}{l}
{x-1} \\
{r-1}
\end{array}\right) p^{r-1}(1-p)^{(x-1)-(r-1)}
$$


The probabilty of the rth success that occures on the xth trial is: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X=x) &=p \times\left(\begin{array}{c}
{x-1} \\
{r-1}
\end{array}\right) p^{r-1}(1-p)^{(x-1)-(r-1)} \\
&=\left(\begin{array}{c}
{x-1} \\
{r-1}
\end{array}\right) p^{r}(1-p)^{x-r}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mean is:

$$
\mu=\frac{r}{p}
$$
