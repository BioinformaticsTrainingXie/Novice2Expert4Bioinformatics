```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##  Data

```{r}
library(WRS2)
dim(diet)
```



In `diet` dataset, there are 76 people. They undertook one of the thre dieats (referred here as `A`, `B` and `C`). Other background informaiton inlcude `age`, `gender` and `height`. The goal of this study is to investigate which diet was best for losing weight. 



`ANOVA` is the anlayisis of variance to compare 3 or more population means. 



Hypotheses

* H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 ... = μk
* H1: At least one mean mean differs from the others.


```{r}
# Compute the analysis of variance
result <- aov(weight.loss ~ diet.type, data=diet) 
# summary of the analysis
summary(result)
```

Since the p-value is less than the significant level 0.05, we can say that at least one mean of `diet.type` differs from the others. 




Let's see how we can get this result step by step.
