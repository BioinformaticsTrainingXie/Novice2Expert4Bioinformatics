# (PART) Python {-}

# First Perl Program



As all other programming books, we begin with a “Hello world” program. 

```{perl code=readLines("code_python/hello_bioinfor.py"), eval=FALSE}
```

This program show how to display a line a text in Perl. It have several features. We go through each line in detail. 

Line 1 is what we call shebang line. This line starts with shebang construct (`#!`). `/usr/bin/perl` indicates the path of the Perl interpreter. 

Line 3 shows how to print a line of text in Perl. Nearly all programming language use print to display texts on the screen. Here, print is a built-in function in Perl. It print the string of characters (its arguments) between quotation marks (“” or ‘’).
