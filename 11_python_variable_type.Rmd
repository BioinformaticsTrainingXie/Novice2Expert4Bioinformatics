# Varibles in Python 

In Python, a variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 


Unlike other porgramming languages, there is no command for declaring a variable. 


When you assign a value to a variable, 

```{python}
gene_len = 100
GC_number = 25
GC_content = GC_number/gene_len
print(GC_content)
```


```{python}
distance = 100 
distance = 105
print(distance)
```
A variable can be a string. 

```{python}
DNA_seq = "AGCTAGCTAGTCAGCGATCGT"
print(DNA_seq)
```

Python has built in functions than can be used on the variables. 


```{python}
DNA_seq = "AGCTAGCTAGTCAGCGATCGT"
DNA_length = len(DNA_seq)
print("The length of the DNA is: ")
print(DNA_length)
```



## Variable names

There are certain rules you need to follow when you name a variable:

* Must start with a letter (`gene_expr`) or underscore character (`_gene1`). 

* Only alphabetical and numeric characters and underscores can be oncluded (e.g. gene1_tpm).

* Variable names are case-sensitive (`Gene1` and `gene1` are two different variables)
