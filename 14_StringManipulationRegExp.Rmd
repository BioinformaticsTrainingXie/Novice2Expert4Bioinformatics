# String manipulation

## String concatenation

Dot (`.`) can be used to concatenate two strings together. 

```{perl eval=FALSE}
# concatenate two strings together and assing to $z
$z = $x . $y;
# Append $y to $x
$x = $x . $y;
# Append $y to $x
$x .= $y;
```

A more convenient way is to use operator `.=` to append one variable to another. 

As is any other assignments in Perl, if you see an assignment written this way `$x = $x` op expr, where op stands for any operator and expr stands for the rest of the statement, you can make a shorter version by moving the op to the front of the assignment, e.g., `$x op= expr`. The string concatenation operator `.` is just one possible op among many others such as `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.

```{perl eval=FALSE}
my $x = 5;
my $y = 6;
# Add $y to $x
$x = $x + $y;
# Add $y to $x
$x += $y;
```
