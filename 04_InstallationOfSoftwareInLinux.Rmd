# Installation of software in Linux

## Installing a precompiled binary (executable)

For programs that are already compiled (converted from high level source code in a language like C into machine specific code), you are often given some choices and need to determine how to download the version that has the correct CPU architecture for your machine.

## Installation from source code



### Installation of `bwa`

```{sh eval=FALSE}
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2
tar xjvf bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2
cd bwa-0.7.15
make
```

### Install `samtools`

Installation of `Samtools` is one of the best representatives of how to instsall a Bioinformatics tool.

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Download the source code
wget https://iweb.dl.sourceforge.net/project/samtools/samtools/1.3.1/samtools-1.3.1.tar.bz2
# Uncompress the source code
tar xjvf samtools-1.3.1.tar.bz2
# Enter the source code directory.
cd samtools-1.3.1
# Configure the build system
./configure
# Build samtools
make
# Become a `root` user for system-wide install:
su root
# Install `Samtools`
make install
```

```{block2, note-text-samtools, type='rmdtip'}

**Install `samtools` without root previledges**

By default, 'make install' installs samtools and the utilities under
/usr/local/bin and manual pages under /usr/local/share/man.

You can specify a different location to install Samtools by configuring
with --prefix=DIR or specify locations for particular parts of HTSlib by
configuring with --bindir=DIR and so on.  Type './configure --help' for
the full list of such install directory options.

Alternatively you can specify different locations at install time by
typing 'make prefix=DIR install' or 'make bindir=DIR install' and so on.
Consult the list of prefix/exec_prefix/etc variables near the top of the
Makefile for the full list of such variables that can be overridden.

You can also specify a staging area by typing 'make DESTDIR=DIR install',
possibly in conjunction with other --prefix or prefix=DIR settings.
For example,

    make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging prefix=/opt

would install into bin and share/man subdirectories under /tmp/staging/opt.

```


```
./bwa index ref.fa
./bwa mem ref.fa read-se.fq.gz | gzip -3 > aln-se.sam.gz
./bwa mem ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq | gzip -3 > aln-pe.sam.gz
```
