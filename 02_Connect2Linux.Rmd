# Connecting to Linux

## User interfaces

As an operating systemsm, Linux comes with two types of user interfaces: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and command line interface (shell).

GUI means there will be window, buttons, menus, etc. The most popular system with GUI is Windows system (Figure \@ref(fig:windowsGUI)).

(ref:windowsGUI) Windows GUI. 

```{r windowsGUI, fig.cap='(ref:windowsGUI)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/windows_gui.png")
```

Command line interfaces means that you need to type the command line yourself. Usually the results will be displayed as text (Figure \@ref(fig:linuxTerminalExam2)). 

(ref:linuxTerminalExam2) An example of Linux terminal.

```{r linuxTerminalExam2, fig.cap='(ref:linuxTerminalExam2)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/linux_terminal_exam2.png")
```

In Bioinformatics analysis, usually you won't operate directly on the physical machine of the Linux server. Usually you need to connect to the Linux server via a tool, like Putty, Mobaxterm, etc. 

## How to connect

If you want to connect to a Linux server, what you need to know first is:

1) IP address of your Linux server;

2) User name and password of your account;

If you are a Mac OS X user, you can connect to a Linux server by using `Terminal`, a console program included with the operating system. 

For Windows users, I would recommend MobaXterm for remote connection. MobatXterm is an excellent toolbox for remote connection from Windows system. It comes with an X11 server and provides many networking tools and tabbed SSH. It has all the essential UNIX commands in a single portable executable file.

Here I show one example of what you should do When you first open Mobaxterm. You need to follow the numbers in Figure \@ref(fig:mobaxtermInit): click `Session`; then click `SSH`; type the IP or name address of the remote host, check `Specify username` if you need; click `OK`. 

(ref:mobaxtermInit) First open of Mobaxterm.

```{r mobaxtermInit, fig.cap='(ref:mobaxtermInit)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/mobaxterm_init.png")
```

Then you need to type the password. It's OK that you don't see anything when you're typing (Figure \@ref(fig:mobaxtermSavepswd)). Then click `Enter` on the keyboard.For the first time of log-in, you'll be asked to whether to save the password or not. If you say click `Yes`, you won't need to type the password again next time. 

(ref:mobaxtermSavepswd) Type password and save it in Mobaxterm.

```{r mobaxtermSavepswd, fig.cap='(ref:mobaxtermSavepswd)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/mobaxterm_savepassword.png")
```

If you can find a Linux server, it'll be very good. If NOT, here I provided a guest account for you. Here are the user name and password:

```
IP address: 198.211.107.37
User name: guest4bioinfo
Password: nobigfile
```

As you can tell from the password, please do NOT upload BIG files (bigger than 2 MB).

### Set up Linux Lab Environment

One way to get access to a Linux system is to take advantage of Red Hat Enterprise Linux delivered by Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). Red Hat and Amazon Web Services collaborate to provide official Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensed images through Amazon’s on-demand public cloud service at free or low cost.

The guided exercises and labs for this course were written assuming that you will set up an account with Amazon Web Services and use it to start a single, simple system running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. You will connect to that system securely over the internet and use it to practice commands.

At the time of writing, Amazon Web Services provides an AWS Free Tier offering, which gives new users free access to certain sizes of cloud instances and operating environments (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) for up to 750 hours per month, for 12 months.


```{block2, note-text-linuxRedHat, type='rmdtip'}

**Install `samtools` without root previledges**

If you are not eligible for AWS Free Tier or have used up your free tier eligibility, a t2.micro-sized instance (cloud computer) running the same software, is currently estimated to cost between US$0.072 and US$0.08 per hour of compute time, depending on the data center in which the instance is started.

To conserve compute time and any costs, make sure you shut down your cloud instance when you are not using it, and terminate (delete) it when you are completely finished with it.

## Transferring files between local computer and Linux server

To transfer files between local computer and Linux sever, there are two options: 1) GUI application and 2) command line.



* Open FileZilla and then click `File` -> `Site Manager`.

GUI means there will be window, buttons, menus, etc. The most popular system with GUI is Windows system (Figure \@ref(fig:filezilla_screenshot1)).

(ref:filezilla_screenshot1) FileZilla application. 

```{r filezilla_screenshot1, fig.cap='(ref:windowsGUI)', outwidth="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/filezilla_screenshot1.png")
```


### Use command line tools

`rsync` compares the files at each end and transfers only the changed parts of changed files. When you transfer files the first timeo it behaves pretty much like scp, but for a second transfer, where most files are unchanged, it will push a lot less data than scp. It's also a convenient way to restart failed transfers - you just reissue the same command and it will pick up where it left off the time before, whereas scp will start again from scratch.

#### Copy files using `rsync` 

```

```

#### Copying Files with `scp` 

The command `scp` is short for secure copy. It can be used to copy files between hosts on a network. It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as ssh(1).`Scp` will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.

File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host. Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers. Copies between two remote hosts are also permitted.

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl on 198.211.107.37 to the current directory.
scp guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/test.pl ./
```

To copy files from a server to a client, you need to know where the files are located on the server. For example, to copy a single file `~/test.pl` from the server with IP address of 198.211.107.37 to the current directory. 

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl in the current directory to  198.211.107.37
scp ./test.pl guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/
```

To copy files from a client to a server, you need to know where the files you want to put on the server. For example, to copy a single file `test.pl` from the current folder to the HOME folder of the server with IP address of 198.211.107.37. 

If you want to copy an entire directory recursively, you can use `-r` argument. See the example below: 

```{sh eval=FALSE}
# Copy the file test.pl in the current directory to  198.211.107.37
scp -r guest4bioinfor@198.211.107.37:~/bioinfo/ ./
```
